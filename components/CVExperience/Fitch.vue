      As a Quantitative Analyst at Fitch Ratings, I specialized in developing financial
      cash flow and asset-based models to evaluate credit risk in alignment with Fitch
      Ratings' methodologies and criteria. Initially, I focused on transitioning legacy
      Excel and VBA models to Python, significantly enhancing efficiency through
      automation and parallel processing. Over time, my responsibilities evolved into a
      more technical role, where I designed and maintained a robust distributed modeling
      platform utilizing AWS services such as EC2, S3, DynamoDB, Lambda, and Step
      Functions. This platform, designed for extreme burst capacity and high
      availability, now underpins all new model development within the team and enables
      the execution of thousands of models in parallel.
